Crinoline Framework
===================

## Current version
The current version is **0.1.0**, but it's still a *Work in Progress*.

## What's Crinoline
Crinoline is a PHP MVP (Model View Presenter) Framework for quick and easy webapp deployment. The main objective is to provide a well planned structure (thus, the name) for the developer. You can focus on the business logic, the models and the views, but all the routing, the session management, the database handling and query construction is already there for you to use whenever you want.

## Versions
* **0.1.0** : Still in progress.

## History
Crinoline began as multiple wrappers I made for myself (Nekomata toolkit) and the core of a project with multiple user-roles (Lilium). I wanted to understand the MVP pattern so I made my research and came up with a flow that worked on almost any webapp. My team at work and I used it later when we built a CRM and a job exchange system from scratch. This period was very important for what would become Crinoline because we could test the database wrapper, the session wrapper and the main flow.
The contribution of [RZEROSTERN](https://github.com/RZEROSTERN/) was vital for this project and even though we forked in separate ways Nekomata and the core of Lilium to create our own projects, a lot of the creative, analytical and design process was made as a team.
